## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


A lot of the css in this project were mostly trial and error.
I did learn more about breakpoints and configuring tailwind.
Some concepts are still weired when compared with vanilla CSS.



### Continued development

In the future I wish to continue developing with tailwind CSS. It sort of feels easy, although the html gets really clutered,it does help with media queries.


### Useful resources
